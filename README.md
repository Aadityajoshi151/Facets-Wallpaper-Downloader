## üìì Description:
This bot is meant to automate the process of downloading the wallpapers made by the famous digital artist Justin Maller.

It is only capable of downloading the wallpapers from http://www.facets.la/ that **HAVE** the download link on the website as some of the wallpapers do not.

It is only used for automated downloading. I **DO NOT** have the ownership of the website or the artwork present there.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Additional Notes:
- Total size of downloaded wallpapers is 175 MB on 22 November 2020. Might change in future depending on the availability of the download links.
- Time taken depends on the internet speed obviously. Variable for everyone.
- [Wallpaper #37](http://www.facets.la/2013/37/ "Wallpaper #37") does not exist (not even preview). The program skips to #38. If this issue is fixed on the website, I will make the required changes in the code.
